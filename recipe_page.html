    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Fillets</li>
      <li>Couscous</li>
      <li>Baked Beans</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>Jimmy's Sauce</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven/airfryer to 180°C (356°F).</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet or air fryer tray with parchment paper and lightly brush it with oil before placing it into the oven or air fryer.</li>
      <li>Season the chicken fillets generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.</li>
      <li>Place the chicken fillets into the oven or air fryer and cook for 9 minutes. Then, flip them over and continue cooking for another 9 minutes, until golden and fully cooked through.</li>
      <li>Flip the chicken fillets once more and generously brush Jimmy’s sauce onto one side. Return to the oven or air fryer and cook for an additional 4 minutes to allow the sauce to glaze and caramelize slightly.</li>
      <li>While the sauce is glazing, boil water in a kettle to prepare for your side dish.</li>
      <li>Once the 4 minutes are up, flip the chicken fillets again, brush Jimmy’s sauce onto the other side, and cook for an additional 4 minutes until beautifully glazed.</li>
      <li>Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour in just enough boiling water to cover the couscous, with a thin layer of water sitting above the grains. Give it a quick stir, then cover the bowl and let it steam until the couscous is tender and fluffy.</li>
      <li> Once the couscous and chicken is done, open a can of baked beans and spoon your desired amount onto a plate alongside the chicken and couscous.</li>
      <li>Finally, sit back, relax, and enjoy your meal with your favorite beverage of choice.</li>
    </ol>
